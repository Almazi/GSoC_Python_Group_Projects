bs4 = beautiful soup 4 is the html parse
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text)
soup.find_all('h1')[0] #as we are getting a list of python after finding h1

breakdown of line #15 soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, "lxml")
all_h1 = soup.find_all('h1') taking all h1 but not properly parsed

some 'p' texts can be out of main class or from any other/more than one classes in html script. 
so there should be a better way to parse rather than soup.find_all('p')[0].text
